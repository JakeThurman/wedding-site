###Our Story

Jake and I met during Grove City College Move-In day in 2017. After a few awkward interactions (including forgotten names, some bad dancing, a whole season of Stranger Things, and classic dining hall meal dates), we started dating on December 5th. 

Since we KNOW you want to know (just kidding, but we know) - here's the story of how we got engaged:

Flashback to this summer, Jake and I took a unintentionally long walk from my house in Arlington to the bank of the Potomac River in D.C. When we finally made it to the river, Jake lost both shoes in the mud and had to walk back to my house barefoot as both of our phones had died. While it was a bit of a misadventure, all that walking gave us a great opportunity to talk about our future together (and ECONOMICS). 

When Jake was home for spring break this year, he decided that we absolutely HAD TO take advantage of the unseasonably warm day by going for a walk. Little did I know, that Jake had actually been planning to take us to the exact same spot from this summer. When we got there, Jake got down on one knee and asked me to marry him and I said "YES" (well, actually, first I said "No!" but only out of surprise, so it doesn't count). 

We are so excited to start our lives together in Frederick, MD after our wedding day! We are so thankful for the friends and family who have supported us and led us to this point in our lives. We love you!
